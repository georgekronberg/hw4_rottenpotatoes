Feature: create and destroy movies

  As a user
  So that I can add and remove movies from db
  I want to be able to do that

Background: movies have been added to database

  Given the following movies exist:

  And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page

Scenario: create a move
    Given I follow "Add new movie"
    Then  I should be on the create new movie page
    When  I fill in "Test_Title" for "movie_title"
    And   I press "Save Changes"
    Then  I should be on the home page
    And   I should see "Test_Title was successfully created."
